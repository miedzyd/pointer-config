Pointer Config is a small Gtk+ application that configures groups of Gtk device 
types. Particularly useful for graphics tablets.

    * Rotate and resizes bounds
    * Change xinput properties
    * Automatically configure device when plugged in (not working right now)
    * Show an outline around the bounds

Requirements

py2cairo >= 1.8.10
xinput (utility) >= 1.5.99.901 
gobject-introspection
    Gtk >= 3.0
    Gio >= 2.0
    GLib >= 2.0
    Gdk >= 3.0
    GObject >= 2.0
    
Run without installing (i18n doesn't work)

cd <dirname>/pointer-config
glib-compile-schemas ./
export GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR=$PWD XDG_DATA_HOME=$PWD PYTHONPATH=$PWD 
./script/pointer-config

Build RPM

# Requires msgfmt, intltool-merge and rpmbuild
XDG_DATA_DIRS=/usr/share python setup.py bdist_rpm
# if /usr/share is your system's data base directory

Gdk Wrapper

At the time of writing this, gdk_x11_device_get_id is missing from GdkX11
on my preferred distro. This is why Gdk.py was needed.
