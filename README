Pointer Config is a small Gtk application that configures xinput for a given
Gtk device type. In particularly useful for graphics tablets.

    * Uses input from "pointer grabs" to change the bounds.
    * Add margins. Useful for screens that are smaller than a tablet.
    * Changes xinput properties.
    * Automatically configure device when plugged in. (not working right now)
    * Show an outline around the bounds.

Gdk Wrapper

At the time of writing this, gdk_x11_device_get_id is missing from GdkX11
on my preferred distro. This is why Gdk.py was needed.
